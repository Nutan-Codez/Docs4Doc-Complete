* Enable patients to upload, store, and organize their medical records and documents digitally, ensuring they are never lost and can be accessed anytime, anywhere. 

* Allow doctors to save, access, and manage their patients' medical records efficiently, enhancing their ability to provide timely and accurate medical care. 

* Serve as a comprehensive solution for both government and private healthcare organizations, facilitating better healthcare management and record-keeping practices. 

* Provide a user experience similar to the DigiLocker app, ensuring familiarity and ease of use for users.

and healthcare providers.
